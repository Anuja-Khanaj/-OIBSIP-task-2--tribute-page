            <b> Albert Einstein </b> was a German-born theoretical physicist,
            widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential
            physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the
            theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to
            the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and
            quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His
            mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from
            relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous
            equation". His work is also known for its influence on the
            philosophy of science.
            <b>
              He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
              theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law
              of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of
              quantum theory.</b
            >
            His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein"
            becoming synonymous with "genius".Einsteinium, one of the synthetic
            elements in the periodic table, was named in his honor.<br /><br />
            In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle
            year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.[15] These
            outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian
            motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy
            equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics
            could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic
            field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He
            then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a
            paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of
            gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to
            model the structure of the universe.[16][17] He continued to deal
            with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led
            to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.
            He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum
            theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory
            of light.
